# Bookmarks App

## Introduction

> As a user:

> I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:

<ul>
<li>title</li>
<li>url link</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>rating (1-5)</li>
<li>I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app</li>
</ul>

> All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

> I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

> Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

> I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

> I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

> Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

> I can select from a dropdown (a <select>Select</select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
